'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||8|||'The economy created jobs at a surprisingly robust pace in January, the government reported on Friday, evidence that America\'s economic stamina has withstood any disruptions caused so far by the financial tumult in Asia.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||9|||'The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the economy added 358,000 jobs last month, far above the 235,000 forecast by economists.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||10|||'It was the third consecutive month that job generation has been exceptionally strong.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||11|||'With growing opportunities for work drawing more people into the labor force, the unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent last month, just a notch above its quarter-century low.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||12|||'The demand for workers also led employers to raise wages again last month.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||13|||'Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees rose 4 cents, to $12.51.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||14|||'The gain left wages 3.8 percent higher than a year earlier, extending a trend that has given back to workers some of the earning power they lost to inflation in the last decade.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||15|||'But economists said the wage increase was not enough to raise any concerns about higher inflation.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||16|||'And because the Federal Reserve has made clear that it expects the economy to slow in coming months as ripple effects from Asia reach the United States, investors disregarded the large jobs gains, betting that neither a rise in interest rates nor resurgent inflation is looming.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||17|||'Stocks rose, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 72.24 points, to 8,189.49, leaving the index within 70 points of its record high set on Aug. 6.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||18|||'In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation anxiety, prices edged up , pushing down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||19|||'``Job creation is sturdy and we have effective price stability,\'\' said Paul McCulley, an economist at UBS Securities.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||20|||'``The bottom line is that we\'ve got a lovely economy.\'\''
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||21|||'With potential inflation counterbalanced by worries about possible price declines, the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have suggested that they intend to keep interest rates unchanged until the economy tilts clearly in one direction or another.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||22|||'The job figures for January extended a surge in employment gains that began last fall, just when the labor market had showed signs of cooling.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||23|||'After accounting for a small downward revision Friday to December\'s figures, the economy has been creating jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for the last four months _ and 381,000 over the last three months _ after averaging 242,000 for the first nine months of 1997.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||24|||'The surge in jobs reflects a remarkable confluence of positive and self-reinforcing economic forces.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||25|||'Inflation has been almost nonexistent, and consumer confidence has been extremely strong.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||26|||'After a short, sharp drop when Asia\'s financial problems first became clear, the stock market has rebounded and corporate profits have remained healthy.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||27|||'Long-term interest rates, an important indicator of economic stability, have fallen in the last few months.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||28|||'Lower rates have helped invigorate housing and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy by making loans more affordable, and have allowed companies to continue investing heavily in more efficient equipment.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||29|||'The likelihood that the federal budget will soon move from deficit into surplus has further improved the outlook.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||30|||'The less money the government needs to borrow, the more is freed for private investment.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||31|||'President Clinton welcomed the job figures at a news conference Friday.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||32|||'His advisers said the results reflected not just from balancing the budget, but also initiatives like improved access to education and training and the opening of foreign markets to trade.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||33|||'``There are enormous economic and social benefits from our nation\'s high-employment economy,\'\' said Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the White House\'s Council of Economic Advisers.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||34|||'Some of the biggest employment gains came in the construction industry, which added 92,000 jobs in January.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||35|||'The increase reflected the strength of the housing industry, which has been helped not just by declining interest rates but also by unusually warm weather.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||36|||'Service industries also showed solid job gains, as did manufacturers, two areas expected to be hardest hit when the effects of the Asian crisis hit the American economy.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||37|||'The major harm from Asia is likely to come from the plunge in the value of many Asian currencies relative to the dollar, a situation that is expected to lead to a surge of inexpensive imports into the United States, hurting American competitors.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||38|||'And the weakness of the Asian economies is also likely to lead to decreased demand for American exports.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||39|||'``The economy has been running on the fumes of the strength from before the Asia shock,\'\' McCulley said.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||40|||'``Those fumes will exhaust themselves, and the manufacturing sector is going to start getting beat up in the spring.\'\''
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||41|||'The figures showed the unemployment rate for adult men declined to 3.8 percent last month from 4.1 percent in December, the lowest figure for almost two decades.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||42|||'The rate for adult women rose 0.4 percent, to 4.4 percent.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||43|||'For the first time, the Labor Department broke out unemployment by education level as well as gender, age and race.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||44|||'The analysis showed unemployment rates dropped steadily with higher levels of education.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||45|||'Among people with less than a high school education, the rate in January was 7.2 percent.'
'NYT19980206.0460.tml'|||46|||'Among high school graduates, the rate was 3.9 percent, and college graduates, 1.9 percent.'

'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||5|||'He apparently hopes to lure support from Arabs who have spurned him so far by suggesting that Iraq will use its occupation of Kuwait as a lever to solve the Arab world\'s most frustrating problem, the 23-year Israeli occupation of land claimed by Palestinians.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||6|||'Even as Saddam Hussein was searching for a ploy to ease his isolation, though, the international pressure against him clicked up another notch.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||7|||'The White House yesterday disclosed that Kuwait\'s ousted government has formally asked the U.S. to enforce the total trade embargo the United Nations has imposed on Iraq, allowing the U.S. and other nations to immediately begin stopping ships carrying Iraqi goods.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||8|||'Secretary of State James Baker, speaking on ABC News\' "This Week," said the Kuwaiti request gives the U.S. and other countries "a legal basis for stopping the export of oil and that sort of thing."'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||9|||'The U.S. maintains that under the U.N. charter, the Kuwaiti request triggers steps for the collective enforcement of international sanctions.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||10|||'Mr. Baker declined to use the word blockade, but said that "interdiction" of Iraqi shipments would begin " almost instantly."'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||11|||'In a statement, the White House said it would do "whatever is necessary" to ensure compliance with the sanctions.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||12|||'Other Bush administration officials said that the international naval force in the area -- consisting of American, British, French, Canadian, Soviet, German and Australian ships -- may be used both to stop oil exports from leaving Iraq and Kuwait and to stop shipments of food and other goods from going in.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||13|||'President Bush implied as much yesterday when reporters asked whether the interdiction would apply to food.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||14|||'The president responded, "Everything, everything."'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||15|||'While shying away from actually using the word "blockade," Mr. Bush acknowledged that the U.S. and others were trying to block shipping to Iraq.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||16|||'"No point getting into all these semantics," he said.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||17|||'"The main thing is to stop the oil from coming out of there."'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||18|||'The naval interdiction force is part of an overall American strategy that officials say is designed to leave the Iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of Kuwait or launching new attacks to change his situation.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||19|||'Though they insist they are n\'t trying to lure Saddam Hussein into an attack, officials hope that if he strikes again, the U.S. and its allies will have such an impressive force in place in Saudi Arabia that they will be able to crush him in retaliation.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||20|||'Iraq\'s first option, of course, may be simply to sit tight and hope it can endure a trade embargo longer than the West can live without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.'

'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||23|||'So Saddam Hussein on Friday tried to scare other Arab leaders into supporting him by calling on Arabs to rise up in a holy war against leaders who invited American and other Western soldiers into Saudi Arabia to protect the oil-rich kingdom.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||24|||'Then yesterday, he tried to entice Arab leaders with his proposal for a diplomatic solution linking his occupation of Kuwait with Israel\'s occupation of the West Bank.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||25|||'The proposal also called for replacing American and other Western troops in Saudi Arabia with Arab forces.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||26|||'The Bush administration immediately said it "categorically " rejects the proposals.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||27|||'And President Bush yesterday, asked whether he was at least glad Iraq is discussing negotiations, replied: "I do n\'t see anything to be pleasing in there at all."'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||28|||'American strategists are calculating , though, that the trade sanctions -- enforced by an effective though perhaps undeclared naval blockade -- will hold tightly enough to convince Iraq that it will lose in the long run by simply standing pat.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||29|||'At that point, rather than go through the humiliation of backing out of Kuwait, the Iraqis might well conclude that they need to lash out in some way to shake things up.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||30|||'In that event, Saddam Hussein appears to have three choices.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||31|||'The first would be to launch the much-feared direct invasion of Saudi Arabia, hoping to seize some Saudi oil fields and improve his bargaining position.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||32|||'But that option is growing less and less likely as thousands of American, British, Egyptian, Syrian and Moroccan forces assemble in and around Saudi Arabia to protect the kingdom.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||33|||'The Saudis even have in their possession 48 Kuwaiti jet fighters, virtually the entire Kuwaiti air force, which managed to escape the Iraqi invasion, Saudi officials said.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||34|||'The Saudi "window of vulnerability . . . is closing very fast," Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, said over the weekend.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||35|||'The second possibility would be to start a fight with Israel, in hopes that all Arabs would have to move behind Iraq in a fight against their common Israeli enemy.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||36|||'In such an event, Saddam Hussein also might calculate, the Saudis would be under pressure to kick out U.S. troops because of America\'s close ties with Israel.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||37|||'Iraq could start hostilities with Israel either through a direct attack or by attacking Jordan.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||38|||'Israel has publicly declared that it will respond to an Iraqi attack on Jordan because it wo n\'t allow Iraq\'s dangerous army to take control of Jordan\'s long border with Israel.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||39|||'Iraq\'s third attack option would be to start an undeclared war on the U.S. and other Western nations through terrorism.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||40|||'Two Middle East terrorists with records of successful attacks against Western targets, Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas, have ties to Baghdad.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||41|||'And even terrorist groups that opposed Iraq in its war with Iran show signs of swinging behind Saddam Hussein now that he is in a confrontation with the U.S.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||42|||'And Iraq still has thousands of Americans and other Westerners under its control in Iraq and Kuwait.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||43|||'They are n\'t being allowed to leave and could become hostages.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||44|||'If Iraq chooses a simple war of nerves and economic attrition, the Bush administration knows a long stalemate could try the patience of the American public and the West in general, and could open the possibility that moderate Arabs -- even including Saudi Arabia -- might drop out of the effort against Iraq and accept some deal from Saddam Hussein.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||45|||'But U.S. officials have sized up Saddam Hussein as a man who, despite some recklessness, will back down if he must.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||46|||'"This is a guy who is impulsive, and therefore capable of big miscalculations," says one senior administration official involved in managing the crisis.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||47|||'The official adds , though, that "at the same time, we think he is someone who is capable of rational judgments when it comes to power.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||48|||'And when he finds something is unprofitable, then one can see certain accommodations."'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||49|||'Thus, administration aides will be trying to calculate whether Saddam Hussein\'s proposed diplomatic formula for getting out of Kuwait represents the first sign he is searching for a way out or simply is a public relations stunt.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||50|||'There are disagreements among experts about how much pressure will be needed to make Saddam Hussein decide he\'s up against the wall and whether simple economic pressure will ever be enough.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||51|||'The biggest worry is that if he decides he needs a way out of his predicament but does n\'t see a face-saving method, he could lash out in dangerous and unpredictable ways.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||52|||'U.S. officials claim they already see signs Saddam Hussein is getting nervous.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||53|||'In the first days after President Bush announced the dispatching of U.S. troops, they note, the Iraqi leader made several nationwide addresses indirectly -- having them read by a television announcer.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||54|||'"That shows he\'s nervous about pinpointing his location, either because he\'s afraid we\'ll find him, or that internal enemies will," says one U.S. official.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||55|||'The unpredictability of Iraq\'s leader is a principal reason the U.S. is going to such great lengths to build a mammoth force in and around Saudi Arabia.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||56|||'Pentagon officials say the goal is to put 40,000 troops in the region by the end of the month.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||57|||'But the administration is n\'t putting any upper limit on how high the force could go after that, calculating that it would be a mistake to underestimate and an advantage to keep Saddam Hussein guessing.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||58|||'U.S. commanders in charge of planning for Middle East crises have indicated in the past that they were capable of deploying as many as 300,000 troops.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||59|||'And the U.S. is taking similar steps to ensure that its naval force is adequate to carry out a blockade of Iraq and support a war if necessary.'
'WSJ900813-0157.tml'|||60|||'Over the weekend, Pentagon officials confirmed reports that a fourth U.S. aircraft carrier -- the John F. Kennedy -- and its powerful group of support ships could head for the Middle East within a few days.'

'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||6|||'"So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic success," said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces.'
'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||7|||'Similarly, while cautioning about the uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said late yesterday that "the operation has been very successful."'
'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||8|||'Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had surrendered, administration aides were also upbeat in private, with one even talking of victory within a week.'
'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||9|||'But even continued military success carries political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S. The allied rejection of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort to avoid the ground war enabled Mr. Bush to seize the initiative from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating peace terms.'

'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||16|||'Despite the early indications of success, the allied forces could still suffer greater casualties and become bogged down militarily , especially when they encounter the tough Republican Guard, which is entrenched along the Iraq-Kuwait border.'
'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||17|||'If so, and if it appears that the American goal actually is to destroy the Iraqi regime even at the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, "the lingering cost of that could be high," worries former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.'

'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||19|||'American officials staunchly disavow any interest in driving through Iraq toward Baghdad, either in pursuit of Saddam Hussein himself or to set up some American-controlled government inside Iraq.'

'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||22|||'Nevertheless, American officials over the weekend became more open in declaring that by destroying Saddam Hussein\'s military machine they hope to destroy his regime -- a goal likely to be supported by most Americans.'

'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||26|||'Of course, it is still far too early to assume that the military situation on the ground will stay as smooth for allied forces as it appears to have been so far.'

'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||29|||'Gen. Schwarzkopf said that some early reports that chemical weapons were used against allied troops turned out to be "bogus."'

'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||54|||'After cabling world leaders about his intention to give Saddam Hussein a final deadline to exit Kuwait, he offered him a week to withdraw fully , instead of the four days he originally considered, because of objections from some European partners that four days seemed punitive and unrealistic.'
'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||55|||'And when he and President Gorbachev spoke about the decision in a talk lasting nearly an hour, the President took pains to listen to what his counterpart had to say, although he already had decided that the Soviet alternative to the allied deadline was unacceptable.'
'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||56|||'Finally, when Iraq failed to respond to the U.S. ultimatum, Mr. Bush let the ground offensive begin as previously planned Saturday night.'

'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||63|||'If the allies succeed, Saddam Hussein will have plunged his country first into a fruitless eight-year-long war against Iran and then into a humiliating war against the U.S. and the allies to defend his conquest of Kuwait, leaving much of his country\'s military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins.'
'WSJ910225-0066.tml'|||64|||'Meanwhile, the U.S. hopes, economic sanctions and an international arms embargo will remain in effect until Iraq pays war reparations to Kuwait to cover war damages.'

'wsj_0568.tml'|||30|||'But we do n\'t minimize the challenges of the near term."'
'wsj_0568.tml'|||31|||'Securities analysts were even more cautious, having been burned repeatedly on Unisys this year.'

'wsj_0575.tml'|||12|||'Noting that the company is offering to buy back $154.2 million in senior notes paying 12 3/4%, he said the response will help determine future debt-reduction efforts.'

'wsj_0583.tml'|||5|||'Polly Peck, a fast-growing British conglomerate, will pay 15.6 billion yen ($110 million) for 39 million new shares of Sansui, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions.'

'wsj_0583.tml'|||7|||'Polly Peck\'s chairman, Asil Nadir, echoed the official Japanese view of the accord, which was announced Friday.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||8|||'"The myths that Japan is not open to concerns from outside has, I think, been demolished at a stroke," Mr. Nadir said.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||9|||'But analysts say Sansui is a special case.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||10|||'It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||11|||'"If you find sound, healthy companies in Japan, they are not for sale," said George Watanabe, a management-consultant at Tokyo-based Asia Advisory Services Inc.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||12|||'Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because unlike Sansui, which is listed on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges, most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||13|||'But by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year, while Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||14|||'Nor do analysts expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||15|||'If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies were n\'t deterrents enough, webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||16|||'Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and the grim demeanors of Sansui\'s directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company\'s finest hour.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||17|||'Sansui was once one of Japan\'s premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||18|||'But in recent years, the market has moved toward less expensive "mini-component" sets, miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||19|||'Some of Sansui\'s fellow audio-specialty companies, such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp., responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own, by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields, including laser disks or portable cassette players.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||20|||'Sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||21|||'As the yen soared in recent years, Sansui\'s deepening financial problems became a vicious circle.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||22|||'While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||23|||'"Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with" changes in the marketplace, said Ryosuke Ito, Sansui\'s president.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||24|||'But even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern, some management consultants maintain.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||25|||'Yoshihisa Murasawa, a management consultant for Booz-Allen amp Hamilton (Japan) Inc., said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||26|||'"Attitudes {toward being acquired} are still negative, but they\'re becoming more positive," Mr. Murasawa said.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||27|||'"In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, acquisitions make sense."'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||28|||'Whether Polly Peck\'s acquisition makes sense remains to be seen, but at the news conference, Mr. Nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||29|||'Sansui, he said, is a perfect fit for Polly Peck\'s electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and other products on an "original equipment maker" basis for sale under other companies\' brand names.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||30|||'He said Polly Peck will greatly expand Sansui\'s product line, using Sansui\'s engineers to design the new products, and will move Sansui\'s production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck\'s own factories.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||31|||'"Whatever capital it (Sansui) needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world, that capital will be injected," Mr. Nadir said.'
'wsj_0583.tml'|||32|||'And while Polly Peck is n\'t jettisoning the existent top-management structure of Sansui, it is bringing in a former Toshiba Corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer.'

'wsj_0584.tml'|||4|||'Moreover, the amended pact shows how McCaw\'s persistence has pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner, forcing huge debt on the proposed new company.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||5|||'The debt, estimated at $4.7 billion, could mortgage the cellular company\'s future earning power in order to placate some LIN holders in the short term.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||6|||'The plan still calls for LIN to combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth\'s and to spin off its broadcasting operations.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||7|||'But under new terms of the agreement, announced Friday, LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $42 a share, representing a payout of about $2.23 billion, shortly before the proposed merger.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||8|||'LIN said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend, but commitments from banks still have n\'t been obtained.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||9|||'Under previous terms, holders would have received a dividend of only $20 a share.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||10|||'In addition, New York-based LIN would exercise its right to buy out for $1.9 billion the 55% equity interest of its partner, Metromedia Co., in a New York cellular franchise.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||11|||'That money also would have to be borrowed.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||12|||'In effect, McCaw has forced LIN\'s hand by bidding $1.9 billion for the stake earlier this month.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||13|||'"We\'re taking on more debt than we would have liked to," acknowledged Michael Plouf, LIN\'s vice president and treasurer.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||14|||'Although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company\'s cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt, he estimated that the company would n\'t be profitable until 1994 or later.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||15|||'Analyst estimate the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $115 to $125 a share.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||16|||'They value McCaw\'s bid at $112 to $118 a share.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||17|||'The previous BellSouth pact was valued at about $98 to $110 a share.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||18|||'McCaw, the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S., already owns about 9.4% of LIN\'s stock.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||19|||'In response to BellSouth\'s amended pact, the Kirkland, Wash., company extended its own offer to buy 22 million LIN shares for $125 apiece, which would give McCaw a 50.3% controlling interest.'

'wsj_0584.tml'|||21|||'Analysts said they expect McCaw to escalate the bidding again.'

'wsj_0584.tml'|||25|||'Under its revised proposal, Atlanta-based BellSouth would have a 50% interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||26|||'To sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional investors -- BellSouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||27|||'The provision, described as "back-end" protection, would require BellSouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||28|||'McCaw\'s bid also has a similar clause.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||29|||'Only McCaw\'s proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||30|||'To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement, BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $10 a share, or $540 million, if, after five years, the trading value of the new cellular company isn\'t as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||31|||'"We\'re very pleased with the new deal.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||32|||'We did n\'t expect BellSouth to be so responsive," said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., which holds 500,000 LIN shares.'

'wsj_0584.tml'|||39|||'he asked.'

'wsj_0584.tml'|||43|||'Indeed, BellSouth\'s cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable.'
'wsj_0584.tml'|||44|||'For 1988, BellSouth earned $1.7 billion, or $3.51 a share, on revenue of $13.6 billion.'

'wsj_0585.tml'|||5|||'Their motivation, however , has a strong practical aspect: Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||6|||'The most controversial form of program trading, stock-index arbitrage, is " making it tough for traders to make money," declares Robert Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson, Lufkin amp Jenrette.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||7|||'Stock-index arbitrage -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- affects the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard amp Poor\'s 500-stock index.'

'wsj_0585.tml'|||9|||'The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading isn\'t known, as it is on the New York Stock Exchange, where it amounted to more than 13% in September.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||10|||'Estimates from traders put it at less than 5% of Nasdaq\'s average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||11|||'Other market-maker gripes: Program trading also causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||12|||'Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves, a condition known as illiquidity.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||13|||'Moreover, the price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely misses them.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||14|||'Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the OTC market.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||15|||'But the big, often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been profiting from the practice against it.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||16|||'Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, acknowledges that he wasn\'t troubled by program trading when it began in the pre-crash bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising.'

'wsj_0585.tml'|||22|||'Of course, there were sell programs in past years, too, but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||23|||'That\'s largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash, when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||24|||'Market makers, to cut costs, slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders are n\'t selling.'
'wsj_0585.tml'|||25|||'And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further, market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress.'

'wsj_0768.tml'|||4|||'Billions of investors\' dollars are pouring out of the nation\'s junk-bond mutual funds, undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||5|||'Last week alone, an eye-popping $1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds, or nearly 5% of their total assets, according to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc., a Boston research firm.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||6|||'In the past two months the nation\'s 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares, Dalbar says.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||7|||'It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||8|||'Interviews with three major fund groups -- Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. -- confirm the trend.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||9|||'Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $500 million, or about 13% of their junk fund assets, in the past two months.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||10|||'Some fund managers say negative publicity has exacerbated investors\' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||11|||'"People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying: `I ca n\'t take it anymore -- I\'m getting out,\'" says Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer amp Janachowski, a San Francisco investment adviser.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||12|||'The withdrawals could spell trouble for the $200 billion junk market.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||13|||'If the heavy outflows continue, fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||14|||'Such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds, already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||15|||'Mutual fund groups have n\'t lost control of much of the outgoing money, says Louis Harvey, Dalbar\'s president.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||16|||'Mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts, and to a lesser extent, government-bond funds.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||17|||'So the impact on the $950 billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||18|||'But tremors are likely in the junk-bond market, which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||19|||'Mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk, accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high-yield, high-risk market.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||20|||'The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $32 billion.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||21|||'Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds, too.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||22|||'The $1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $150 million in the past two months.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||23|||'About $60 million streamed out last week alone, double the level of the week following last month\'s Campeau Corp. credit squeeze.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||24|||'About 98% of the outflow was transferred to other Fidelity funds, says Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president, marketing, with most going into money market funds.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||25|||'"You get a news item, it hits, you have strong redemptions that day and for two days following -- then go back to normal," says Mr. Litvack.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||26|||'The fund, with a cash cushion of more than 10%, has " met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing," Mr. Litvack says.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||27|||'He adds: "Our fund has had {positive} net sales every month for the last three years -- until this month."'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||28|||'Vanguard\'s $1 billion High Yield Bond Portfolio has seen $161 million flow out since early September;'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||29|||'$14 million of that seeped out Friday Oct. 13 alone.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||30|||'Still, two-thirds of the outflow has been steered into other Vanguard portfolios, says Brian Mattes, a vice president.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||31|||'The fund now holds a cash position of about 15%.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||32|||'At the $932 million T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, investors yanked out about $182 million in the past two months.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||33|||'Those withdrawals, most of which were transferred to other T. Rowe Price funds, followed little change in the fund\'s sales picture this year through August.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||34|||'"The last two months have been the whole ball game," says Steven Norwitz, a vice president.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||35|||'Junk-fund holders have barely broken even this year, as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||36|||'Through Oct. 19, high-yield funds had an average 0.85% total return (the price change plus dividends on fund shares), according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||37|||'That\'s even less than the 4.35% total return of the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||38|||'Fidelity\'s junk fund has fallen 2.08% this year through Oct. 19, Lipper says;'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||39|||'the Vanguard fund rose 1.84%;'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||40|||'and the T. Rowe Price fund edged up 0.66%.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||41|||'People who remain in junk funds now could get hit again, some analysts and fund specialists say.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||42|||'Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues, such as RJR Nabisco, to raise cash to meet expected redemptions.'
'wsj_0768.tml'|||43|||'Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers.'

'wsj_0778.tml'|||5|||'The issue has come to a boil in Newark, N.J., where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar that if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted, the government may move to seize the money that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||6|||'The warning by the U.S. attorney\'s office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||7|||'In those cases, the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||8|||'If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar\'s assets, he could be left without top-flight legal representation, because his attorneys are likely to quit, according to individuals familiar with the case.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||9|||'A seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers\' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||10|||'"The people who suffer in the short run are defendants, but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people, because there wo n\'t be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights," says Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||11|||'Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark, where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||12|||'Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant\'s assets before trial.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||13|||'According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar\'s case, prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar\'s attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||14|||'In a letter, prosecutors told Mr. Antar\'s lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||15|||'Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar\'s attorneys that they believe Mr. Antar\'s allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||16|||'Therefore, they said, the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||17|||'Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault, attorneys for Mr. Antar, both declined to comment on the matter.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||18|||'In Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said, "I do n\'t think there\'s any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney\'s fees to drug cases."'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||19|||'Mr. Alito said his office "just responded to an attorney\'s question about whether we would go after attorney\'s fees, and that is different from actually doing it, although we reserve that right."'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||20|||'Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||21|||'In that suit, the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a "massive financial fraud" to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a three-year period.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||22|||'Through his lawyers, Mr. Antar has denied allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||23|||'The SEC has alleged that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company\'s stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||24|||'Mr. Antar, the SEC said, made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||25|||'The Justice Department has emphasized that the government\'s fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||26|||'According to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers\' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||27|||'Still, criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers\' fees.'
'wsj_0778.tml'|||28|||'They also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly, the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid.'

'wsj_0781.tml'|||13|||'To switch to another vendor\'s chips, "would not definitely be an option," he said.'

'wsj_0781.tml'|||15|||'Yesterday, Compaq plunged further, closing at $100 a share, off $8.625 a share, on volume of 2,633,700 shares.'
'wsj_0781.tml'|||16|||'Most of Compaq\'s decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts\' expectations.'

'wsj_0781.tml'|||18|||'"We should not be seeing any more," said Bill Rash, Intel\'s director for the 486 chip.'

'wsj_0781.tml'|||21|||'The bugs will cause problems in "specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications" such as word-processing and spreadsheets, said Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter.'
'wsj_0781.tml'|||22|||'Sun, Hewlett-Packard and others say Intel isn\'t wholly to blame for the snafu.'
'wsj_0781.tml'|||23|||'The real culprits, they said, are computer makers such as IBM that have jumped the gun to unveil 486-based products.'

'wsj_0810.tml'|||4|||'Cie. de Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier said his board unanimously rejected as too low the $1.77 billion bid by Cie. Financiere de Paribas to bring its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7%.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||5|||'At a news conference, Mr. Fournier accused Paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company, whose interests include insurance, banking, tuna canning, sugar and orange juice.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||6|||'The chairman said his board members, including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, hold nearly 50% of Navigation Mixte\'s capital.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||7|||'Mr. Fournier said that as Navigation Mixte chairman, he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||8|||'But sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in Navigation Mixte, which is being traded in London and is to resume trading in Paris Tuesday.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||9|||'At the same time, he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying Paribas\'s bid.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||10|||'For the moment, the sources said, he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a counterbid for Paribas.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||11|||'Mr. Fournier said Navigation Mixte\'s 1989 unconsolidated, or parent-company, profit is likely to be 4.7 billion francs ($754.4 million), up from 633.8 million francs last year.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||12|||'That is due mostly to payments from Allianz for most of the 50% stake it has agreed to acquire in Navigation Mixte\'s insurance business.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||13|||'Mr. Fournier said the exceptional gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||14|||'If holders avoid tendering to Paribas, he added, they can expect strong dividends again next year.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||15|||'Analysts noted that over the past 20 years, Mr. Fournier has built his company through astute stock-market activity and has warded off at least three takeover attempts.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||16|||'This time, however, some analysts think he could face a real battle.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||17|||'"Without some unexpected "coup de theatre", I do n\'t see what will block the Paribas bid," said Philippe de Cholet, analyst at the brokerage Cholet-Dupont amp Cie. Mr. de Cholet said Mr. Fournier\'s biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||18|||'Paribas still needs the go-ahead from the Commission des Operations de Bourse, a government regulatory agency, but analysts said that is considered likely.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||19|||'Mr. Fournier also noted that Navigation Mixte joined Paribas\'s core of shareholders when Paribas was denationalized in 1987, and said it now holds just under 5% of Paribas\'s shares.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||20|||'Once he realized that Paribas\'s intentions weren\'t friendly, he said, but before the bid was launched, he sought approval to boost his Paribas stake above 10%.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||21|||'The petition is still pending, but Mr. Fournier downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much-larger Paribas.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||22|||'One big question now is the likely role of Mr. Fournier\'s allies.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||23|||'Mr. Fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly 50% of Navigation Mixte\'s capital all strongly support him, but some analysts said they aren\'t so sure.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||24|||'Allianz, for example, has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral.'
'wsj_0810.tml'|||25|||'Paribas is Allianz\'s lead French bank.'

'wsj_1013.tml'|||6|||'Total assets increased to $12.7 billion in the latest quarter from $12.4 billion a year earlier.'
'wsj_1013.tml'|||7|||'The loss stems from $357.5 million of write-downs on Columbia\'s $4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio, which includes about $3.7 billion of junk bonds, $400 million of preferred stock, and Treasury securities.'
