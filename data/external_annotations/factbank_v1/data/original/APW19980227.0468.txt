MOSCOW (AP) _ The mayor of Moscow  has allocated funds  to help
build a museum in honor of Mikhail Kalashnikov, the Russian who
gave his name to the world's most widely wielded weapon, according
to a news agency report Friday.
Kalashnikov designed the AK-47 automatic rifle, famed for its
reliability and effectiveness. Together with its derivatives, the
Kalashnikov rifle  has  been used by the police and armies of 55
countries and an assortment of guerrillas, terrorists and just
plain thugs around the globe.
Seventy-five million copies of the rifle  have  been built since
it entered production in February 1947, making it history's most
widely distributed weapon.
