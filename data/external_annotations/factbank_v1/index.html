    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p> FactBank 1.0, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2009T23 and 
  isbn 1-58563-522-7, consists of 208 documents (over 77,000 tokens) from newswire 
  and broadcast news reports in which event mentions are annotated with their 
  degree of factuality, that is, the degree to which they correspond to those 
  events. FactBank 1.0 was built on top of <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006T08">TimeBank 
  1.2</a> and a fragment of the <a href="http://www.timeml.org/site/timebank/timebank.html">AQUAINT 
  TimeML Corpus</a>, both of which used the TimeML specification language. This 
  resulted in a double-layered annotation of event factuality. TimeBank 1.2 and 
  AQUAINT TimeML encode most of the basic structural elements expressing factuality 
  information while FactBank 1.0 represents the resulting factuality interpretation. 
  The combination of the factuality values in FactBank with the structural information 
  in TimeML-annotated corpora facilitates the development of tools aimed at automatically 
  identifying the factuality values of events, a component fundamental in tasks 
  requiring some degree of text understanding, such as Textual Entailment, Question 
  Answering, or Narrative Understanding. 
<p>FactBank annotations indicate whether the event mention describes actual situations 
  in the world, situations that have not happened, or situations of uncertain 
  interpretation. Event factuality is not an inherent feature of events but a 
  matter of perspective. Different discourse participants may present divergent 
  views about the factuality of the very same event. Consequently, in FactBank, 
  the factuality degree of events is assigned relative to the relevant sources 
  at play. In this way, it can adequately reflect the divergence of opinions regarding 
  the factual status of events, as is common in news reports. 
<p>
  The annotation language is grounded on established linguistic analyses of the 
  phenomenon, which facilitated the creation of a battery of discriminatory tests 
  for distinguishing between factuality values. Furthermore, the annotation procedure 
  was carefully designed and divided into basic, sequential annotation tasks. 
  This made it possible for hard tasks to be built on top of simpler ones, while 
  at the same time allowing annotators to become incrementally familiar with the 
  complexity of the problem. As a result, FactBank annotation achieved a relatively 
  high interannotation agreement, kappa=0.81, a positive result when considered 
  against similar annotation efforts. 

<h3>Data</h3>

    
<p>All FactBank markup is standoff and is represented through a set of 20 tables 
  which can be easily loaded into a database. Each table resides in an independent 
  text file, where fields are separated by three consecutive bars (i.e., |||). 
  The data in fields of string type are presented between simple quotations ('). 
<p>Because FactBank 1.0 was built on top of TimeBank 1.2 and AQUAINT TimeML, both 
  of which are marked up with inline XML-based annotation, this release contains 
  the TimeBank 1.2 and AQUAINT TimeML annotation in standoff, table-based format 
  as well.
