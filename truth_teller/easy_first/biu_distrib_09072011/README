EasyFirst parsing to Stanford Dependencies


to run:

python sdparser_server.py


wait until two models are loaded.

then point your browser to:
http://localhost:8080/


to submit things to be parsed:
send a "post" request to "parse", with a field named "tagged_text" containing the text to be parsed.


Not working?
if you have a "ImportError: No module named ml" error or similar, check out the binary ml model (see INSTALL under shared/ml)
otherwise: email me  (yoav.goldberg@gmail.com)
